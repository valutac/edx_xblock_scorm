# Steps

In order to support an external SCORM player such as the SSLA player, additional Nginx configuration is needed.

*  The files `/edx/app/nginx/sites-enabled/lms` and `/edx/app/nginx/sites-enabled/lms` are generated by the Nginx Ansible role at `/edx/app/edx_ansible/edx_ansible/playbooks/roles/nginx` from the `configuration` repository [https://github.com/edx/configuration](https://github.com/edx/configuration).  The `lms` and `cms` Nginx configuration files are generated from Jinja2 `lms.j2` and `cms.j2` templates in `/edx/app/edx_ansible/edx_ansible/playbooks/roles/nginx/templates/edx/app/nginx/sites-available` directory.

## Copy the included files from this repo

* Copy the files to include, [extra_locations_lms.j2](nginx_extra_files/extra_locations_lms.j2) and [static-files-extra.j2](nginx_extra_files/static-files-extra.j2) into the `/edx/app/edx_ansible/edx_ansible/playbooks/roles/nginx/templates/edx/app/nginx/sites-available` directory.  (Fork of /edx/configuration adds these files to the `.gitignore` file so they will not interfere with subsequent `git pull`s.)

## Add include statements to default Nginx j2 templates

* Add Nginx `include` statements to pull in your own external `.j2` templates, following instructions below.  (Added these include statements to our fork of edx/configuratiodn
  * Edit `/edx/app/edx_ansible/edx_ansible/playbooks/roles/nginx/templates/edx/app/nginx/sites-available/lms.j2`.  Add the following just below `{% include "static-files.j2" %}` and just above the last closing `}`.  

  ```
    {% include "extra_locations_lms.j2" ignore missing %}
  ```
  - Edit `/edx/app/edx_ansible/edx_ansible/playbooks/roles/nginx/templates/edx/app/nginx/sites-available/static-files.j2`.  Add the following just above `expires epoch`: 
  ```  
      {% include "static-files-extra.j2" ignore missing %}
  ```
  * You do not need to edit `cms.j2`.  

Note: If your configuration directory (`edx_ansible/edx_ansible`) on the server is checked out from GitHub, as it most likely is, these two files will be marked as modified and will cause further `git pull`s from /edx/configuration to fail when running `/edx/bin/update` or otherwise running any Ansible playbook which pulls updates from GitHub to the edx_ansible code directory. (not relevant for fork of /edx/configuration)




## Run Ansible Nginx role

* Once you have done this, rerun the Nginx Ansible role for the LMS and CMS sites with this commands on your edxapp server.
  - `sudo /edx/app/edx_ansible/venvs/edx_ansible/bin/ansible-playbook -i localhost, -c local /edx/app/edx_ansible/edx_ansible/playbooks/run_role.yml -e"role=nginx"  -e"@/edx/app/edx_ansible/edx_ansible/playbooks/roles/edxapp/defaults/main.yml" -e"@/edx/app/edx_ansible/server-vars.yml" -e'{"nginx_sites":["lms", "cms"], "nginx_default_sites": ["lms"]}' -t install:configuration -vvv`

* This will update the `lms` and `cms` configuration on Nginx and should reload the Nginx configuration.  To make sure you have the new configuration in place,:
```
sudo service nginx configtest
sudo service nginx reload
```


*You should now be able to use the SCORM XBlock.*
